        <h3>Microservices Sprawl</h3>
        <p>
          Cloud-native applications are architected as a constellation of
          distributed microservices, which run in containers, orchestrated
          through kubernetes. Adopting a microservices architecture brings a
          host of benefits, including increased autonomy, flexibility and
          modularity. But the process of decoupling a monolithic application
          into smaller services introduces new obstacles: How do you know what’s
          running? How do you roll out new versions of your services? How do you
          secure and monitor all those containers?
        </p>
        <p>
          Most companies using microservices architecture don’t fully understand
          until they are well down the path about microservices sprawl. The
          number of small services that are deployed expand exponentially and
          this exponential growth in microservices creates challenges around
          figuring out how to enforce and standardize things like routing
          between multiple services/versions, authentication and authorization,
          encryption and load balancing within a Kubernetes cluster. Building on
          service mesh helps resolve some of these issues, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          As containers abstract away the operating system from the application,
          a service mesh abstracts away how inter-process communications are
          handled. Istio is a widely adopted open-source service mesh that helps
          organizations run distributed, microservices-based apps. Its  powerful
          features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect
          and monitor services, so DevOps can modernize their apps more swiftly
          and securely. Whether you’re building from scratch or migrating
          existing applications to cloud native, Istio addresses the challenges
          developers and operators face with a distributed or microservices
          architecture.
        </p>

      <div class="wysiwyg">
        <h3>The Genesis of Istio</h3>
        <p>
          To explain what Istio is, it’s also important to understand the
          context in which Istio came into being — i.e., why is there an Istio?
        </p>
        <p>
          Microservices are a technical solution to an organizational problem.
          And Kubernetes and Istio are technical solutions to deal with the
          issues created by moving to microservices. As a deliverable for
          microservices, containers solve the problem of environmental
          consistency and allow for more granularity in limiting application
          resources. They are widely used as a vehicle for microservices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google open-sourced Kubernetes in 2014, which grew exponentially over
          the next few years. It became a container scheduling tool to solve the
          deployment and scheduling problems of distributed applications —
          allowing you to treat many computers as though they were one computer.
          Because the resources of a single machine are limited and Internet
          applications may have traffic floods at different times (due to rapid
          expansion of user scale or different user attributes), the elasticity
          of computing resources needs to be high. A single machine obviously
          can’t meet the needs of a large-scale application; and conversely, it
          would be a huge waste for a very small-scale application to occupy the
          whole host. In short, Kubernetes defines the final state of the
          service and enables the system to reach and stay in that state
          automatically.

        <h3>What is Istio?</h3>
        <p>
          Istio is an open-source service mesh that helps organizations run
          distributed, microservices-based apps. It provides a way to secure,
          connect and monitor microservices. Istio layers transparently onto
          existing distributed applications and sits as an overlay between the
          layers of distributed applications. Istio works natively with
          Kubernetes (K8s) only, but its open source nature makes it possible
          for anyone to write extensions enabling Istio to run on any cluster
          software. Istio includes APIs that let Istio integrate into any
          logging platform, telemetry or policy system. Istio enables
          intelligent application-aware load balancing from the application
          layer to other mesh-enabled services in the cluster. It bypasses the
          rudimentary kube-proxy load balancing. 
        </p>
        <p>Istio’s powerful control plane brings vital features including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with TLS
            encryption, strong identity-based authentication and authorization
          </li>
          <li>
            Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic
          </li>
          <li>
            Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules,
            retries, failovers, and fault injection
          </li>
          <li>
            A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access
            controls, rate limits and quotas
          </li>
          <li>
            Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a
            cluster, including cluster ingress and egress
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
      </div>

      <div class="wysiwyg">
        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        <p>
          Istio’s core consists of a control plane and a data plane, with Envoy
          as the default data-plane agent. The following diagram shows the
          various components of each plane:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/images/why-istio-diagram.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Istio is designed for extensibility and can handle a diverse range of
          deployment needs. Istio’s control plane runs on Kubernetes and you can
          add applications deployed in that cluster to your mesh, extend the
          mesh to other clusters, or even connect VMs or other endpoints running
          outside of Kubernetes.
        </p>
        <hr />
      </div>

      <div class="wysiwyg">
        <h3>How do Istio, Envoy and Kubernetes work together?</h3>
        <p>
          The key to understanding Isto and the Istio architecture is to
          understand both Envoy and Kubernetes. It’s not a question of Istio
          versus Envoy or Istio versus Kubernetes - they often work together to
          make a microservices-based containerized environment operate smoothly.
          For example, service meshes like Istio are made up of both a control
          plane and a data plane. Istio uses an extended version of Envoy as its
          data plane. Envoy then manages all inbound and outbound traffic in the
          Istio service mesh. Kubernetes is an open source platform that gets
          rid of many of the manual processes involved in deploying and scaling
          containerized applications by automating and orchestrating them. And
          although Istio is platform independent, using Istio and Kubernetes
          together is popular among developers. In addition, Kubernetes stands
          as a cornerstone for building cloud-native applications. It offers key
          features such as self-healing capabilities, service discovery, load
          balancing and secret management, which are essential for running
          applications at scale in distributed environments. Its inherent
          support for mulit-cloud deployments, microservices architecture and
          CI/CD pipelines positions it as a pivotal element in the DevOps and
          cloud computing ecosystems.
